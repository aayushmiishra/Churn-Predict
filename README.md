Customer Churn Prediction using ANN
This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn based on various customer attributes. The model is trained on structured data and aims to classify whether a customer is likely to leave a service or not.

Uses TensorFlow/Keras to build a deep learning model.
Binary classification with sigmoid activation in the output layer.
Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss for training.
Scales input features using MinMaxScaler for better convergence.
Evaluates performance using confusion matrix & accuracy score.
